            <h2>1. Lost Balance</h2>
            <iframe src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1V5j8EoDLWFegGf4MhcCjKVbaJqhwOdkeVNiKFQ-Tqz8&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='100%' height='650' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen frameborder='0'></iframe>
            <p class="caption">Sources: <a href="https://flickr.com">Flickr</a>, <a href="https://www.agclassroom.org/gan/timeline/gov.htm">Growing a Nation</a>, <a href="https://listverse.com/2013/04/10/10-terrible-famines-in-history/">Listverse</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_history_of_environmentalism">Timeline of History of Environmentalism</a>, <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-american-agriculture-farm-machinery-4074385">ThoughtCo</a></p>
            <p>Historically, agricultural modernization involved a delicate balance between environmentalism and industrialization, regulation and commercialization; between investing in tomorrow's research or addressing today's poverty. Environmentalism helped alleviate the some of the consequences of industrialization, especially through pollution laws passed during the Environmental Movement in the 1960s and 1970s. Government regulation ensured that the benefits of industrialization reached everyone equitably through nutrition assistance programs such as food stamps and school lunches, and that agencies such as the FDA and USDA minimized commercial misconduct. <i>Foreign Policy</i> accredits today's "<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/26/attention-whole-foods-shoppers/">modern, science-intensive, and highly capitalized agricultural system</a>" with the research of new foods that helped feed the growing population. Over time, competing forces reached an equilibrium: environmentalists counteracted industrialization's potential for ecological damage, regulation reined in commercial exploitation, and breakthroughs in research ensured that the increasing population would be fed with a greater supply of food.<p>
            <p>But equilibrium doesn't imply equality. Third-world farmers are the victims of a balance that merely preserves a status quo that keeps American corporations on top. Environmentalism is an important issue to first-world countries which have the capacity to sacrifice subsistence for conservation, but overzealous environmentalists often hinder agricultural industrialization in developing countries that still need to meet their demand for food. Moreover, the power of agricultural regulation agencies only stretches within national borders, and the politicians that administer these agencies are only incentivized to answer to their domestic constituents. Companies incorporated in the United States continue to operate unrestrained abroad, "<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/45ddc1a0-e70a-11e1-8a74-00144feab49a">pillaging poor nations, destroying forests to produce the palm oil used in a multitude of goods from soap to cakes, [and] putting five-year-olds to work fruit-picking and killing orangutans</a>," as reported by Louise Lucas. And today's "science-intensive and highly capitalized" research into proprietary seeds and other GMOs has unfairly concentrated power to "<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/27/local/me-15218">corporations that control not only food processing and distribution but farm inputs and seed patents</a>," according to the Frances Moore Lappe.</p>
            <p>Third-world farmers will need to claim a role in agriculture's ongoing narrative by industrializing, balance notwithstanding.</p>

            <h2>2. No Profit, No Problem</h2>
            <iframe src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/storyline/latest/embed/index.html?dataURL=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1-6MGkHa6ssP0AVW4JCn6oMbC9TGNXCtwTVkiQyDgHmM%2Fedit%23gid%3D0&amp;dataYCol=numberinpoverty&amp;dataXCol=year&amp;dataDateFormat=%25Y&amp;chartDateFormat=%25Y&amp;chartYLabel=Billions%20in%20Poverty&amp;sliderCardTitleCol=title&amp;sliderCardTextCol=text" style="width:100%;height:550px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" vspace="0" hspace="0" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            <p class="caption">Sources: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-in-extreme-poverty-absolute">Our World in Data</a>, <a href="http://www.foodreference.com/html/html/yearonlytimeline.html">FoodReference.com</a></p>
            <p>The word "industrialization" often carries the baggage of commercial exploitation and environmental ruin, but nonprofit-driven industrialization has admirably gained the American public's respect. Justin Gillis describes how "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/science/earth/05harvest.html">[f]orty years ago, a third of the population in the developing world was undernourished, [but by] the tail end of the Green Revolution, in the mid-1990s, the share had fallen below 20 percent, and the absolute number of hungry people dipped below 800 million for the first time in modern history</a>." While some critics such as Robert Paarlberg note that the Green Revolution <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/26/attention-whole-foods-shoppers/">came with its own problems such as increased inequality</a>, Gillis's heartening statistics reassure the public that agricultural industrialization persisted for a noble cause.</p>
            <p>Public opinion of agricultural industrialization has also benefited from the generosity of the forces behind it. Soon after Dr. Norman Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for pioneering industrial-scale production of new wheat varieties and "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/science/earth/05harvest.html">provid[ing] bread for a hungry world</a>," the <i>New York Times</i> reported how leading researchers "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/science/earth/05harvest.html">founded an international network of research centers to focus on the world's major crops</a>." As researchers who targeted reducing hunger over increasing profits, they further reinforced agricultural industrialization's positive reputation. Nonprofits took notice of the massive humanitarian potential of industrialization, and they became the primary benefactors of agricultural research and development. <i>Foreign Policy</i> asserts that "<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/26/attention-whole-foods-shoppers/">international assistance from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and donor governments led by the United States made Asia's original Green Revolution possible</a>." Without profit as a motive, nonprofits prioritized community impact over raw output when providing support to farmers, cementing their status as both an effective and principled source of assistance.</p>
            <p>Nonprofits gained the respect of the American public during our period of agricultural industrialization, and nonprofits will presumably gain the trust of third-world farmers during theirs.</p>

            <h2>3. Need for Seed</h2>
            <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smile-wide/gghmjencocgfkbmfhccmfngonpbhlldf/reviews"><img src="../images/logo.png" style="width: 200px"></a>

            <p>Third-world farmers need funding to industrialize and compete in the global market now more than ever. Robert Paarlberg contends that "<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/26/attention-whole-foods-shoppers/">wherever the rural poor have gained access to improved roads, modern seeds, less expensive fertilizer, electrical power, and better schools and clinics, their productivity and their income have increased</a>." These farmers will need massive investments, especially since "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/science/earth/05harvest.html">Western aid for agricultural development in poor countries fell by almost half</a>," but we need to recognize that the source of funding is even more important than the amount.</p>
            <p>Commercial initiatives should be welcomed, but not be relied upon. Corporate investment is often ephemeral; investment is withdrawn when profits cannot be realized immediately. The indifference of corporations has produced a calamity in which "<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/27/local/me-15218">hundreds of millions of people who go hungry cannot create a sufficient 'market demand' for the fruits of the Earth</a>," in the words of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. Even when companies decide to fund development in third-world countries, their investment doesn't prioritize the interests of the farmers they employ. The <i>Financial Times</i> reports that "<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/45ddc1a0-e70a-11e1-8a74-00144feab49a">companies' ultimate obligation is to shareholders, not to smallholders in Ecuador or Angola</a>."</p>
            <p>In contrast, nonprofits don't have shareholder obligations; at <a href="https://oneacrefund.org">One Acre Fund</a> (an <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/one-acre-fund/720">A-rated charity</a>), their <a href="https://oneacrefund.org/what-we-do/farmers-first/">Farmers First</a> approach emphasizes that industrializing African farmers is "<a href="https://oneacrefund.org/what-we-do/farmers-first/">everything [they] do</a>." One Acre Fund provides the <a href="https://oneacrefund.org/what-we-do/our-model/">latest seeds and training on modern agricultural techniques to farmers</a>, and they measure their success by the relative gain in farmer income. Last year, farmers were able to achieve a staggering <a href="https://oneacrefund.org/impact/">71% income increase</a> by industrializing with One Acre Fund.</p>
            <p>If you agree that it's time for third-world farmers to industrialize and compete against corporations, you can <a href="https://oneacrefund.org/give/">donate to One Acre Fund</a> directly. Alternatively, you can install a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smile-wide/gghmjencocgfkbmfhccmfngonpbhlldf">Google Chrome extension</a> I published, which inconspicuously donates a portion of your <a href="https://amazon.com">Amazon</a> purchases to a charity of your choice, at no added cost to you thanks to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201365340">Amazon Smile</a>. Either way, your support in modernizing third-world farmers will send a clear message to today's dominant foreign corporations: your time is up.</p>
