            <h1>Modernizing Third-World Agriculture with Charity</h1>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            </br>
            <h2>1. Lost Balance</h2>
            <iframe src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1V5j8EoDLWFegGf4MhcCjKVbaJqhwOdkeVNiKFQ-Tqz8&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='100%' height='650' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen frameborder='0'></iframe>

            <p>Historically, agricultural modernization involved a delicate balance between industrialization and environmentalism, commercialization and regulation; between investing in tommorrow's research or addressing today's poverty. Environmentalism has helped alleviate the some of the consequences of industrialization, especially through pollution laws passed during the Environmental Movement in the 1960s and 1970s. Government regulation ensures that the benefits of modernization reaches everyone equitably through nutrition assistance programs such as food stamps and school lunches, and that agencies such as the FDA and USDA minimize commercial misconduct. <i>Foreign Policy</i> accredits today's "<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/26/attention-whole-foods-shoppers/">modern, science-intensive, and highly capitalized agricultural system</a>" with the research of new foods that have helped feed the growing population. Over time, environmentalists counteracted industrialization's potential for ecological damage, regulation reined in commercial exploitation, and breakthroughs in research ensured that the increasing population would be balanced with a greater supply of food.<p>
            <p>But equilibrium doesn't equal equality. Third-world farmers are the victims of a balance that merely preserves the status quo. Environmentalism is an important issue in first-world countries that have the capacity to sacrifice subsistence for conservation, but overzealous environmentalists often hinder agricultural industrialization in developing countries that still need to meet their demand for food. Moreover, the power of agricultural regulatory agencies only stretches within national borders, and the politicians that administer these agencies are only incentivized to answer to their domestic constituents. Companies incorporated in the Unted States continue to operate unrestrained abroad, "<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/45ddc1a0-e70a-11e1-8a74-00144feab49a">pillaging poor nations, destroying forests to produce the palm oil used in a multitude of goods from soap to cakes, [and] putting five-year-olds to work fruit-picking and killing orangutans</a>," as reported by Lucas Louise in the <i>Financial Times</i>. And today's "science-intensive and highly capitalized" research into proprietary seeds and other GMOs has unfairly concentrated power to "<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/27/local/me-15218">corporations that control not only food processing and distribution but farm inputs and seed patents</a>," according to the Frances Moore Lappe in <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. Third-world farmers will need to industrialize and take a prominent role in agriculture's ongoing narrative, balance notwithstanding.</p>

            <h2>2. No Profit, No Problem</h2>

            <p class="caption">Source of poverty data: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-in-extreme-poverty-absolute">Our World in Data</a></p>
            <p>The word "industrialization" carries the baggage of commercial exploitation and environmental ruin, but nonprofit-driven industrialization has gained the public's respect. Justin Gillis describes how "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/science/earth/05harvest.html">[f]orty years ago, a third of the population in the developing world was undernourished, [but by] the tail end of the Green Revolution, in the mid-1990s, the share had fallen below 20 percent, and the absolute number of hungry people dipped below 800 million for the first time in modern history</a>". While some critics such as Robert Paarlberg note that the Green Revolution <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/26/attention-whole-foods-shoppers/">came with its own problems such as increased inequality</a>, Gillis's heartening statistics reassure us that agricultural industrialization persisted for a noble cause. Public opinion of agricultural industrializaton has also benefited from the heroism of the forces behind it. Soon after Dr. Norman Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for pioneering industrial-scale production of new wheat varieties and "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/science/earth/05harvest.html">provid[ing] bread for a hungry world</a>," the <i>New York Times</i> reported how leading researchers "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/science/earth/05harvest.html">founded an international network of research centers to focus on the world's major crops.</a>" As researchers who prioritized reducing hunger over increasing profits, they further reinforced agricultural industrialization's positive connotation. Nonprofits took notice of the massive humanitarian potential of industrialization, and they became the primary benefactors of agricultural research and development. <i>Foreign Policy</i> asserts that "<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/26/attention-whole-foods-shoppers/">international assistance from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and donor governments led by the United States made Asia's original Green Revolution possible</a>". Without profit as a motive, foundations were able to bolster industries focused on philanthropy over profit. Nonprofits gained the respect of the American public during our period of agricultural industrialization, and they are in the best position to gain the trust of third-world farmers during theirs.</p>
            <p>Paarlberg contends that "<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/26/attention-whole-foods-shoppers/">wherever the rural poor have gained access to improved roads, modern seeds, less expensive fertilizer, electrical power, and better schools and clinics, their productivity and their income have increased</a>".</p>
            <p>Whereas charities finance agriculture to provide a long-term investment towards third-world economic development, many corporations spend money only to meet their own short term profit targets. Since "<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/45ddc1a0-e70a-11e1-8a74-00144feab49a">companies' ultimate obligation is to shareholders, not to smallholders in Ecuador or Angola</a>" (according to the <i>Financial Times</i>), communities need agriculural industrialization to take a different form, one led by nonprofits.</p>

            <p>But when capitlism fails and "<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/27/local/me-15218">hundreds of millions of people who go hungry cannot create a sufficient 'market demand' for the fruits of the Earth</a>" (according to the Los Angeles Times), alternatives must be found.</p>
            <p>Within 20 years, "Western aid for agricultural development in poor countries fell by almost half."</p>
            <p>One Acre Fund answers Frances Moore Lappe's calls for "<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/27/local/me-15218">communities in tune with nature's wisdom</a>". With <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/one-acre-fund/720">an A rating from CharityWatch</a> and <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=13262">a score of 94.28 out of 100 from Charity Navigator</a>, One Acre Fund is a legitimate and reputable charity that directly helps African smallholders modernize.</p>
            <p>Today, contributing to causes such as modernizing agriculture is as easy as ever.</p>
