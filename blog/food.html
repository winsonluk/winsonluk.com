            <h1>Modernizing Third-World Agriculture with Charity</h1>
            <p>Introduction</p>
            <h2>Rooted in Controversy</h2>
            <p>Just the mere suggestion of industrializing agriculture elicits skepticism in many people. And this hesitation is not without merit. In the name of modernization, corporations are "<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/45ddc1a0-e70a-11e1-8a74-00144feab49a">pillaging poor nations, destroying forests to produce the palm oil used in a multitude of goods from soap to cakes, putting five-year-olds to work fruit-picking and killing orangutans</a>," according to Lucas Louise in the <i>Financial Times</i>. But to reliably evaluate the merits of industrialization, we need to separate the tools and techniques of industrialization from the entities that abuse them. The timeline below helps us remember that when Norman Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for pioneering industrial-scale production of new wheat varities, he was commended for "<a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1970/press.html">provid[ing] bread for a hungry world</a>" <i>despite</i>, not because of, corporate "<a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1970/press.html">bureacracy [and] prejudice</a>".</p>

            <h2>High Yields</h2>
            <p>Robert Paarlberg urges Westerners to appreciate their own "<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/26/attention-whole-foods-shoppers/">modern, science-intensive, and highly capitalized agricultural system</a>" in an article in <i>Foreign Policy</i>. Farming innovations such as industrial machinery and biotechnology greatly increased the amount of food that could be grown with scarce resources, and coordinated agricultural systems such as cooperatives allowed for more efficient allocation of labor. In the <i>New York Times</i>, Justin Gillis describes how "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/science/earth/05harvest.html">[f]orty years ago, a third of the population in the developing world was undernourished, [but by] the tail end of the Green Revolution, in the mid-1990s, the share had fallen below 20 percent, and the absolute number of hungry people dipped below 800 million for the first time in modern history</a>". While humans have innovated agricultural techniques since the first farms, the chart below exemplifies how groundbreaking modern developments in industrial agriculture have allowed for the pace of innovation to catch up with our growing population despite continuing social issues. </p>

            <h2>Sowing New Seeds</h2>
            <div class="pdf"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/75982352" title="One Acre Fund Program Model" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
            <p>Whereas charities finance agriculture to provide a long-term investment towards third-world economic development, many corporations spend money only to meet their own short term profit targets. Since "<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/45ddc1a0-e70a-11e1-8a74-00144feab49a">companies' ultimate obligation is to shareholders, not to smallholders in Ecuador or Angola</a>" (according to the <i>Financial Times</i>), communities need agriculural industrialization to take a different form, one led by nonprofits.</p>
            <p>It's going to be difficult to compete against "<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/27/local/me-15218">corporations that control not only food processing and distribution but farm inputs and seed patents</a>" according to the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. But when capitlism fails and "<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/27/local/me-15218">hundreds of millions of people who go hungry cannot create a sufficient 'market demand' for the fruits of the Earth</a>" (according to the Los Angeles Times), alternatives must be found.</p>
            <p>Nonprofit initiatives have successfully kickstarted agricultural modernization before. In <i>Foreign Policy</i>, Robert Paarlberg argues that "<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/26/attention-whole-foods-shoppers/">international assistance from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and donor governments led by the United States made Asia's original Green Revolution possible</a>". But since the end of the Green Revolution, the <i>New York Times</i> notes that "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/science/earth/05harvest.html">Western aid for agricultural development in poor countries fell by almost half</a>". Today we need a new charity-funded Green Revolution, one that again tackles the challenge of feeding our ever-growing population with a focus on communities, not profit.</p>
            <p>Paarlberg contends that "<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/26/attention-whole-foods-shoppers/">wherever the rural poor have gained access to improved roads, modern seeds, less expensive fertilizer, electrical power, and better schools and clinics, their productivity and their income have increased</a>".</p>
            <p>One Acre Fund answers Frances Moore Lappe's calls for "<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/27/local/me-15218">communities in tune with nature's wisdom</a>". With <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/one-acre-fund/720">an A rating from CharityWatch</a> and <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=13262">a score of 94.28 out of 100 from Charity Navigator</a>, One Acre Fund is a legitimate and reputable charity that directly helps African smallholders modernize.</p>
